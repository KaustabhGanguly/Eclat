# Eclat
I used the Eclat associative rule machine learning algorithm in R


## It is exactly same like the Apriori algorithm project I made

# The steps I followed are :
- Set a minimum support
- Take all subsets in transactions having higher support than minimum support
- Sort the support by decreasing support
